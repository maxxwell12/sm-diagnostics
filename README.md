##Getting Started
1. [Download](https://github.com/jasonclemons/SMF-Diagnostics-Center/archive/master.zip) the package. 
2. Create a `.tar` or `.zip` archive of the included source. (Sorry, I'm too lazy to create builds at the moment...)
3. Install it using SMF's built-in [Package Manager](http://wiki.simplemachines.org/smf/Package_manager).
4. It's as simple as that!

##Using It
SMF Diagnostics Center is meant to be used for debugging and support purposes. It provides information that could be critical to determining where a problem may lie.

To use the diagnostics center, look under the `Maintenance` tab in your Admin dashboard. You will find a tab named `System Diagnostics`, and there you will find all the functions and features this addon includes. These features include:

* System Overview
* PHP Info
* File Whitespace Check
* File Permissions Check
* Connection Check
* Email Tester
